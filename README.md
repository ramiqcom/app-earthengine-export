Application to preview satellite imagery using Google Earth Engine and export the data as GeoTIFF or as tile map for web map.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Demo app to use
